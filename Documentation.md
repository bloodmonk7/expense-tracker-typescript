# Overview

## Project Development Approach

- I will start this project with making the Navigation bar with user information and logout button.
- I will focus on Dashboard after that with all the details and buttons for adding expenses and incomes.
- Now I will add a list for showing expenses with the categories they belong to and also use a doughnut from chart.js to show data visually.
- Now I will split all the frontend into components so that they remain seperate from each other and modularity remains the way it should be.
- I will add functionalities now to the components.
- After splitting I will first create a pop-up modal component that can be used for adding expenses, incomes and deleting entries in expense categories.
- Now for incomes I will show a list and a delete button along with items.
- In Expenses, user will be able to add expenses in existing categories from a list below or they can create a new category with name and a color assigned to it for visualization.
- If someone clicks on a category name, modal will show entries in that expense category and also allow user to delete an entry like adding income modal.

## Phases
